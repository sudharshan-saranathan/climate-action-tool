## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow industry-standard conventions for chosen language/framework
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create feature branches for new development
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Aim for meaningful test coverage

## Environment Setup

*Instructions will be added once technology stack is determined*

## API Documentation

*API documentation will be added as endpoints are developed*

## Data Sources

Potential data sources for climate information:
- Carbon Interface API
- EPA Emissions Data
- IPCC Climate Data
- Local utility companies

## Security Considerations

- Protect user privacy and personal data
- Secure API endpoints
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security audits

## Contributing

Guidelines for contributing to this project will be established as development progresses.
